Open test.xls and copy over column headings, change #Words to words
Title	Publisher/Author	F	GRL	Box	#books	Level 	words	keyword

Make the first row's Box and words fields strings by prepending a single ' in front of it.  If done correctly, they'll be left justified in the field instead of right justified.

then in windows, open mergeTemplate.docx
	Mailings -> Select Recepients (pick test.xls that was the output of the process above)
	Finish & Merge -> Edit Individual Documents

Save!!

Copy/Replace ".0" with nothing.
