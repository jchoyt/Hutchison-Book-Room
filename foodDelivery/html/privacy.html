        <h3>
            PRIVACY POLICY
        </h3>
        We, the operator of Invasion, acknowledge and respect your privacy. This purpose of this document is to inform you of our data security policies and
        measures. You will find information regarding what data is collected and saved, as well as how it is used here. This privacy policy applies explicitly
        to the game Invasion. These terms do not affect any other website or service, whether they are linked to on this website or not.
        <h3>
            1 Which information is acquired and how is it used?
        </h3>
        <h3>
            1.1 Personal Data
        </h3>
        Personal data is unique information pertaining to yourself. When you register at Invasion, you enter your email address and an account name (pseudonym)
        of your choice. Your password is digitally encrypted and saved, therefore we can not retrieve your password if you should forget it. If you provide
        your email address, however, a new password can be generated and emailed to you. Your email address will not be sold, shared, or used for any other
        purpose.
        <h3>
            1.2 Financial Data
        </h3>
        Financial data is required to carry out the steps necessary to process donations. If your payment is made via a third party service such as Paypal or
        others, we only save the information that the service provider has passed on to us, for example, your transaction number. With this transaction number,
        we can check the payment with the service provider. The service provider is responsible for saving the transaction data in this case. Invasion has no
        influence on how third party service providers handle their data.
        <h3>
            1.3 Player Data
        </h3>
        Player data refers to your character information. This data will be stored and used only for in-game purposes.
        <h3>
            1.4 Usage Data
        </h3>
        Usage data is acquired through usage of the web site, for example page views or the browser type being used to access the services. On every log in,
        the IP address* and browser type are saved in addition to the time of the log-in. It is crucial to collect this information in order to prevent the
        creation of unauthorized multiple accounts (called Multi accounts) in Invasion. This ensures the balance in game is not tampered with and allows for
        fair game play for all.
        <h3>
            2 Who is the data passed on to?
        </h3>
        Other web sites, services, or other third parties are never given data by Invasion.
        <h3>
            3 Privacy Protection for children
        </h3>
        Here at Invasion we believe that the privacy of children should be protected! We call upon all parents and parental guardians to accompany their
        children while they are on the Internet! We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The services offered by Invasion
        are not offered to anyone under 13 years of age.
        <h3>
            4 Changes to the Privacy Policy
        </h3>
        Under the circumstance that the privacy policy chances, we will update this document and the time stamp located at the bottom. Additionally, we will
        announce the information regarding the change on the main page of Invasion. This will make it possible to view which data is being collected online and
        how it is being used at any time. <br />
